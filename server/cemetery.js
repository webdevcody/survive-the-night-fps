// The dead come up out of the ground at St. Agnes Cemetery (shared/cemetery.js builds the place and names its
// graves: world.cemetery.graves).
//
// By night: when a wave starts with a survivor within CEMETERY.NEAR of the cemetery, a share of that wave's walkers
// and runners is taken out of its queue and comes up out of the graves instead, a few seconds apart - inside
// whatever the survivors have walled off round the chapel. The horde is no bigger for it: only where part of it
// arrives changes. Specials and bosses still come from the treeline.
// By day: a few graves are restless (drawn at every sunrise), and each gives up one walker to the first survivor
// who comes within CEMETERY.WAKE of it.
//
// A rise is fair warning: the earth of the grave heaves and is heard (EVT.GRAVE) CEMETERY.STIR before anything
// shows, and the zombie then takes CEMETERY.RISE to climb out (ZANIM.RISE). It does nothing until it is out, and it
// is an ordinary zombie from the moment it spawns: its feet start under the ground and come up, so the terrain hides
// what is not out yet from the eye and from bullets, and a head above the grass can be shot like any other.
