// worker of each game posts (room-worker.js RemoteRecords, rooms.js Room.record).
//
// A player signed in to an account is filed under 'u:<user id>'. A guest - not signed in, as anybody can play - is
// filed under 'g:<SHA-256 of their browser's id>' as before there were accounts, and that record moves onto their
// account when they register or sign in from that browser (claimGuest). The browser id itself is never kept.
//
// The board's stats (kills, nights, wins, revives) and XP are counted as they happen and written every couple of
// seconds, a row per player at most per write (flush). The rest - games, deaths, downs, headshots, the furthest day,
// time played - come with each stint of a match as it ends (addStint, from matchstore.js).
