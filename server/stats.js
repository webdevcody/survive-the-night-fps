// The leaderboard: what every player has done over all the games they have played, kept by the server.
//
// A player is known by the id their browser made up on its first launch and sends in its JOIN
// (client/net/identity.js). That id is the one thing that proves who they are - whoever knows it plays as them -
// so it goes no further than enter(): a record is filed under the id's SHA-256, which is all the stats file
// holds, and what a client is sent (board) names a player by the name they play under and nothing else.
//
// The file (STATS_FILE, see server/index.js), JSON:
//   { v: 1, players: { <sha-256 of the id, hex>: { name, kills, nights, wins, revives, seen, xp, perks, respecs, best } } }
//   name    the name they last joined under          kills    the dead they put down (zombies, turned players)
//   nights  nights they were alive at the end of     wins     runs their team escaped from, with them in the game
//   revives teammates they got back on their feet    seen     when they were last in a game (ms since 1970)
//   xp      experience earned (shared/progress.js)   perks    the perk ids they picked, in order (absent: none)
//   respecs times they started their picks over      best     the furthest day they saw dawn on (absent: none)
// Without a file the records last as long as the process does (tests, sims).
