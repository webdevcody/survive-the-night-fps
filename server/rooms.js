// traffic into one message per batch each way (wire.js), and answers for the records the games keep (stats.js).

// link gets you in). Either way its code is the way in. An invite-only game's code is long enough not to be found by
// guessing, and an address that keeps asking for codes that are not there is told every code is not there for a
