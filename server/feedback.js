// What players think of the game, asked of them as a run ends (migrations/004, 020): how hard it was, and the run's
// best and worst moment, on the end screen (client/ui/endscreens.js EndScreen); and, once per player, whether they play
// survival / FPS games at all, so the report can tell the two kinds of voter apart. A vote is filed against the match the voter has just finished - found here from
// who they are, by their account or their browser's guest key, so the client never has to know a match's id - and
// one vote per player per match: voting again changes it. What comes back is how everyone has voted, for the bars.
//
// Only a match that ended as runs end on an end screen (victory or wipe) a few minutes ago, with the voter still in
// it at its end, takes a vote: anything else is a 404, so a vote cannot be cast for a run nobody saw end.
