// Server entry, the network thread: uWebSockets.js transport (binary WebSocket at /ws), the lobby's HTTP API
// (/api/games), static file serving of the built client (dist/) and a /status JSON endpoint. The games themselves
// run in worker threads, one game server each (rooms.js, room-worker.js); this thread routes every socket to its
// game by the code in its URL (/ws?game=CODE), or with no code to whichever public game a quick join picks.
//
// With a database (DATABASE_URL, db/index.js) it also has accounts (/api/auth, auth.js), friends and direct
// messages (/api/friends, /api/messages and the /social socket, social.js), the leaderboard in Postgres
// (dbstats.js) and a record of every match played (matchstore.js). Without one it runs as before: the leaderboard in
// a file (stats.js), nobody signed in.
//
// A deploy does not end the games (handoff.js): on SIGTERM each is saved into the store and its players are sent
// HANDOFF_CLOSE, and the new server - up by then - restores it under the same code for them to reconnect to.
