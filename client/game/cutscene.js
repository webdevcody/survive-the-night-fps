// The run's two cutscenes, played in the game's own engine with the game's own things: the crossing between the acts
// (the car, with the survivors in it, leaves the island with the horde behind it and drives the broken bridge to the
// mainland) and the take-off the run ends on. Like the splash's walk round the valley (menutour.js) each is a
// sequence of camera shots, a cut or a fade between them; unlike it, they run off the server's clock, so every
// client sees the same moment at the same time (shared/acts.js CROSSING, TAKEOFF_TIME).
//
// While one plays, Game hides the HUD and the hands, takes no input but the skip key, and puts its camera where the
// shot says (Game.update). The world behind it is the real one: the island for the first shots of the crossing, then
// - behind a cut to black and a loading card (LoadingCard), when the server says so - the mainland. Every camera is worked out from the world it is in (the road, the bridge's plan, where the city
// and the runway are), so a shot holds for any seed.
