// The mounted gun, client side (the rules: shared/mountedgun.js, the server: server/mountedgun.js).
// The server replicates one entity for it (ENT.GUN: belt, gunner or carrier, where it was left pointing, where its
// tripod stands and faces, and whether it stands, is carried or lies). Here:
//   - the gun on its tripod, turned for everyone by whoever mans it (their replicated view, held inside the arc);
//     on its side where it was dropped; in the arms of whoever carries it
//   - manning it: [E] at the grips, predicted the way the flashlight is (the press shows at once, the server
//     has the last word a moment later); stepping away lets go
//   - lifting it: [E] held at it (a server hold, with its progress ring), from the grips, from beside it, or from
//     wherever it lies. Carrying it: half pace and empty hands (the simulation's s.hmg); [E] sets it up where you
//     face, [G] or any weapon key drops it
//   - the gunner's own shots, drawn on the command that fires them: the same step the server runs on the same
//     commands (stepGun), so the report, the flash, the tracer and what the round strikes need no round trip.
//     While manning, the fire button goes into the commands as BTN.GUN and not BTN.ATTACK, so the simulation
//     leaves the weapon in the hands alone (and [R] is the belt's, not the magazine's)
//   - everyone else's shots (EVT.SHOT with MOUNTED_GUN as the weapon), from the muzzle
//   - the gunner's view: the gun's rear and their hands on the grips in place of the weapon they carry; the
//     carrier's: the same gun, lower, swaying with their stride
