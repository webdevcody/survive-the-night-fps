// Three ways to play the same valley. Nightfall is the game as it has always been: every number below is 1,
// and a game that does not name a difficulty is Nightfall. Ember is for someone who does not really play
// shooters. Blackout is for someone who does.
//
// What actually knocks a new player down is not one big number. They miss. They do not headshot. They stand
// still while a runner closes, because sprinting and looking at the same time is its own skill. They spend
// the first day lost, so dark arrives before they have a wall or a bandage. Ember answers each of those,
// and leaves the rest of the valley alone: the same map, the same guns, the same car to fix.
//
// Stamina is not one of the levers. It is stepped on the server and on each player's own machine from the
// same constants, and a per-game rate would have the two disagree about every sprint. Longer days and
// slower dead cover "I cannot sprint and aim" without that split.
//
// Aim help is a slightly wider body, not a wider head and not a camera that turns for you. A shot that
// passes close still counts. A shot that was going to be a headshot is still a headshot only if it hits
// the head. Both sides judge shots against the same shape (shared/hitbox.js), so the client has to be
// told the difficulty (S2C.ROOM) or its hit markers would lie.
