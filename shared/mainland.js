// The mainland: the second map of a run (act 2, shared/acts.js), built from the same seed as the island the team
// escaped from and with the same kit (worldkit.js), so it is drawn, walked and fought on by the code that runs the
// island. It is twice as far across (MAINLAND_SIZE: 1280 m, four times the area) and laid out west to east the way
// the run goes:
//
//   the sea | the bridge comes ashore at the Bridgehead, on a bluff | Route 9 runs east over the coastal plain |
//   Port Calder, a ruined city of streets and blocks | the Mile 9 truck stop | Calder Field: a runway, hangars, a
//   terminal with its tower, a fuel depot, and the plane
//
// with Kessler Ironworks on a spur north or south of the city, the houses of Eastgate on the other side and two farms
// out on the plain. What a
// seed changes: where the bridge lands, where the city, the ironworks and the airfield sit, what stands on every
// lot of every block, the course of the roads between them, and everything that is scattered.
//
// A world made here has every field createWorld's has (world.js); what the island has and this map does not (the
// mine, the railway, the fair, the clinic, the cemetery) is null. On top of those:
//   bridge   where the bridge is (bridge.js): the cutscene drives the car along it, and the client draws it
//   runway   the runway and what stands on it: { x, z0, z1, half (its half width), y, truck: { x, y, z, ry } }
//   car      is the plane: the thing this act's supplies go into and its final stand is fought at (plane: true)
//   partSpots[i].supply   which of the plane's parts lies there (an index into PLANE_PARTS): they are at set places
//   props[i].live   set on the car at the bridgehead and on the plane: the client draws those two itself, because its
//            cutscenes move them (the car drives to that very spot; the plane is swapped for the one that flies)
//   city     { x, z, pitch, grid, lots: [{ x, z, w, d, ry, what }] }: what was built on every lot of Port Calder; and
//            what its buildings are drawn from (buildings, rooms, shells, heaps, fallen, pancakes, signs: see
//            "What the city is drawn from" below, and client/render/citykit.js)
//   parts[i].hidden   a solid that is not drawn as the box it is (the kit draws that building, wall or heap)
//   farms    [{ x, z, ry }]: the farms out on the plain (no place names them: their loot is a farm's)
//   river    { pts, hw, bridges: [{ x, y, z, ry, len, w }] }: its middle line, half its width, and where roads cross it
