// Ground transport: the moped, the car and the bicycle. The rules both ends share.
//
// A vehicle is one entity (ENT.VEHICLE, server/vehicles.js). It is found broken, standing where somebody left it
// (vehicleSpots), and is fixed with what the valley has: scrap, tape, batteries, gun parts (FIX). Fixed, it wants
// fuel - the Fuel every generator and the flamethrower burn (AMMO.FUEL) - except the bicycle, which wants legs.
//
// Driving is part of the player simulation, as a handcar is (handcar.js): while a survivor drives, the vehicle is
// in their simulated state - `drive` its entity id, `driveK` its kind, `dyaw` where it points, `dsteer` its
// steering, `dfuel` what is in the tank, and the survivor's own x / y / z and vx / vz are the vehicle's (the middle
// of it on the ground, and how it moves over it). Every command steps it (stepVehicle) with the same numbers on
// the client and on the server, so the driver's prediction is the server's result and nothing is sent while they
// drive; the server only speaks when something it alone knows of touched the vehicle (the dead in its way, a blow).
// Nobody at the wheel, the server steps it with the same function until it stands.
//   W / S        throttle; brake, and from a standstill reverse
//   A / D        steer: less lock the faster it goes
//   Space        handbrake: the back wheels lock, and the tail comes round
//   Shift        (bicycle) stand on the pedals, on stamina
// Passengers are carried: `pass` (the entity id) and `passN` (the seat) in their state stop their feet, and the
// server puts them in the seat every tick. Their hands are free.
