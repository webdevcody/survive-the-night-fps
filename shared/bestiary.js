// The bestiary: every kind of the dead (ZTYPE), the order the book lists them in, and what it says of each - a vague
// line while the player has never seen one, and once they have, a tip on how it fights and how to fight it. A
// player's record is a bitmask of ZTYPEs (bit t: seen a kind t), kept per account in Postgres (server/userbestiary.js,
// user_bestiary) and per browser for a guest (client/net/bestiary.js).
//
// Seeing one (server/bestiary.js): one of that kind, alive, within SEEN_RANGE metres of the survivor's eye with a clear
// line to its head - walls, trees, the lie of the land and the rock of the mine block it; the dark and the fog do not.
