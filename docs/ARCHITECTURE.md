# Survive The Night — Architecture & Conventions

Multiplayer co-op horror survival FPS. three.js client (Vite), authoritative Node server on uWebSockets.js,
custom binary protocol with per-client delta compression, client-side prediction + reconciliation,
entity interpolation and server-side lag compensation.

## Layout

```
shared/      code used by BOTH server and client (pure JS, no DOM, no three.js)
  constants.js   tick rates, physics, map, timings
  defs.js        items, weapons, recipes (stations + schematics), structures, containers, car supplies,
                 zombie types, sounds, events (wire ids)
  protocol.js    Writer/Reader, message ids, quantization, snapshot / command packet / entity update layouts
  layout.js      plans the valley for a seed: the course of Route 9, the lake and ponds, which named places
                 there are (PLACES: the core ones + a random draw) and where, and which the roads join
                 (a spanning tree out from Route 9 + loops)
  world.js       deterministic world generation from a seed: builds the plan - terrain, A*-routed roads,
                 roadside/woodland sites, buildings, props, containers, supply spots, doorways,
                 vegetation, colliders. A new playthrough is a new seed (S2C.WORLD_RESET); SEED pins it
  mine.js        the workings under Blackrock Mine: a second level under the heightfield (see The mine below)
  clinic.js      Mercy Clinic and the rule that its wards are dark at noon (see Dark interiors below)
  rail.js        the railway: its heights, the cut and fill, Whitlock Depot, the stalled train (see The railway)
  collision.js   static/dynamic collider grids, ray casts
  playersim.js   deterministic player movement + weapon simulation (prediction on client, authority on server)
  nights.js      night themes: nightTheme(seed, night) picks what a night's horde is made of. The server applies
                 it to the wave weights and the client announces it, each from the seed: nothing on the wire
server/      authoritative game server (uWebSockets.js)
  index.js       the network thread: sockets, the lobby's HTTP API, static files, /status (see Many games below)
  rooms.js       the lobby: the games running, routing sockets to them, codes, allowances, the leaderboard's side
  room-worker.js one game server: a worker thread running one Game and its tick loop
  wire.js        the packed frames the two threads pass sockets' messages in
  game.js        the simulation of one game (Game), and everything it sends
client/      three.js client (Vite root)
  index.html, main.js
  net/        connection, snapshot decode, interpolation, prediction
  game/       client game state, entity views, input, weather schedule (weather.js)
  render/     renderer, sky, terrain, vegetation, water, post, particles, weather fx, textures, materials, models/
  audio/      WebAudio engine: procedural synthesis + CC0 recordings in audio/samples/ (samples.js loads
              them after init; any sound whose file fails to load/decode falls back to its procedural version)
  ui/         DOM HUD (hud.js + hud2.js: compass, objective, world markers, downed, summary), field map
              (mapcanvas.js bakes it, mapscreen.js shows it), splash, inventory/crafting, build menu, chat,
              contextual key hints (keyhints.js: reads the game state once a frame, owns its one HUD line)
  sandbox/    standalone dev pages for visually testing modules (not shipped)
scripts/     dev runner, headless screenshot helper (scripts/shot.js), look-dev harness (scripts/lookdev.js)
```

## Conventions

- ES modules everywhere. `import * as THREE from 'three'` on the client.
- Units: meters, seconds, radians. Y is up.
- **Facing:** yaw = rotation about +Y. yaw 0 faces **-Z**. forward = (-sin(yaw), 0, -cos(yaw)).
  Models must be authored so their FRONT faces **-Z**; then `object.rotation.y = yaw` orients them.
- Camera: Euler order `'YXZ'`, `rotation.y = yaw`, `rotation.x = pitch` (pitch > 0 looks up).
- Human player: capsule radius 0.35, height 1.8 m, eye height 1.62 m.
- The camera is not exactly the simulated eye: the client eases it over step-ups and step-downs
  (`Prediction.viewLag`: the simulation takes a kerb or a floor slab within one command) and dips it on landings
  (`Game.landDip`). Presentation only; anything that must agree with the server (where a shot leaves from) uses
  the simulated state, not `camera.position`.
- Materials: prefer `MeshLambertMaterial` (performance). Share geometries and materials; never allocate
  in per-frame paths. The scene keeps a FIXED number of lights (light count changes force shader recompiles);
  toggling a light's `castShadow` also recompiles, so only quality changes do it.
- Textures are procedural canvas textures. Audio is synthesized, with CC0 recordings in
  `client/audio/samples/` (credited in its CREDITS.md; CC0 only) layered over it; every recording keeps its
  procedural fallback (see Audio below).
- Performance budget: 60 fps on a mid-range laptop GPU with ~80 zombies on screen. One draw call per zombie
  (single SkinnedMesh, rigid skinning), instanced vegetation, merged static geometry.

## Networking

One binary WebSocket per client (reliable + ordered, so every delta is simply against "what was last sent").
Layouts live in `shared/protocol.js`; `npm run bench:net` (`scripts/net-bench.js`) measures the traffic of a
seeded session and says where the bytes go - run it before and after touching anything below. Per client it is
about 1.3 KB/s down + 0.4 KB/s up of payload in 40 packets/s in a night-3 fight, and at that size the 40-odd
bytes of TCP/IP + WebSocket framing per packet are half of what crosses the wire: **a new message type costs
more than its bytes**, so put things into the packets that already flow.

- **Up: commands.** The client simulates at 60 Hz and sends one `C2S.INPUT` per server tick
  (`CMDS_PER_PACKET` commands; `Prediction.takeOutbox` sends earlier on a long frame and batches
  `CMDS_PER_PACKET_IDLE` while no key is held and the view is still). `writeInput` / `readInput`: the first
  command in full, the rest as deltas. The packet also carries the render time (lag compensation), a fingerprint
  of the predicted state (`hashPlayerState`) and, every 2 s, a ping bit that `EVT.PONG` answers in a snapshot.
  One render time per packet means a shot must not wait for the batch: a frame that fires or swings sends at
  once. On the server that render time stays with the packet's commands in the queue (`Game.processInputs`
  hands it to `Combat.rewindTime` as each one runs), and the per-tick command allowance banks up while nothing
  arrives (`CMD_QUEUE_MAX`) and refills slightly faster than commands are issued (`CMD_CATCH_UP`), so a burst
  that arrives late after a hiccup is run at once instead of standing in the queue from then on.
- **Early presses** (`client/game/inputbuffer.js`). The simulation acts on the press of fire, reload and jump,
  not on the button being down, so a press that comes a moment before it can act would do nothing. The client
  holds such a press out of its commands' buttons until the first command that can act on it (150 ms for fire
  and jump, the weapon draw for reload), and presses R itself when an automatic runs dry with the trigger held.
  Whether a press acts is asked of `simulatePlayer` on a scratch copy of the state, so a new rule in the
  simulation needs no counterpart there. This only shapes what the client sends: `Prediction.step` simulates the
  shaped command, and the server never knows.
- **Down: one snapshot per tick** (`Game.sendTick`), corked together with the player list and inventory when
  those changed. A flags byte (`SNAP`) says which sections follow; tick and acked command are implied
  (+1, +`CMDS_PER_PACKET`) unless flagged. A client whose socket is backed up is skipped, never sent a snapshot
  that then gets dropped (that would break every delta).
- **Own state** (`Game.writeSelf` / `readSelf`): the simulated part of `p.state` is NOT replicated while the
  client's prediction holds. It is sent (`SELF.SYNC`: the client rebases and replays) only in the first
  snapshot, while dead, when the fingerprint that came with a command disagrees with the server's state after
  that command, or when anything else changed the state - detected by comparing against `p.shadow`, the copy
  taken right after the last command, so code that shoves, teleports, arms or disarms a player needs no
  bookkeeping. On a sync the server rounds its own floats to what went on the wire (`snapPlayerState`) so both
  ends continue from identical numbers. A new field of the simulated state must be added to `copyPlayerState`,
  `samePlayerState`, `snapPlayerState` (floats), `hashPlayerState`, a `writeSelf` chunk and `readSelf`.
  Server-driven values the HUD shows (hp, armor, battery, hold progress...) are the status groups: sent when
  they change. `scripts/test-netsync.js` shoves a player on a laggy link and checks both ends agree again
  within a round trip.
- **An item in the hands** (`state.using`, `Game.useItem`): while a medkit, a tin or a battery is being used,
  `simulatePlayer` fires, swings, throws and reloads nothing, and a fresh click (or a weapon asked for) puts the
  item away unused (`use_cancel`) and brings the weapon back out (`DRAW_TIME`); a button held since before is no
  click. The server runs the use's clock (`updatePlayers`) and finishes it, which brings the weapon out too: that
  covers the round trip it takes the client to hear of it. Starting one needs no rebase: the client sends every
  command it has made before `ACT.USE_ITEM` (`Game.useConsumable`) and has the hands on the item from its next one
  (`Prediction.startUse`), and the server raises `using` on that same command (`p.useItem.from`, the one after the
  newest that had come in). It is the one field of the simulated state in no `writeSelf` chunk: `readSelf` takes it
  from the status's item in use, which the server only names while `using` is up (`Game.endUse`).
- **Entities** (`server/snapshot.js` / `client/net/decode.js`, tables `FIELD_COUNT` + `BIT_SLOTS` in both):
  area of interest per kind, creates in full, updates only for changed fields, sorted by id behind a one-byte
  head (id step, position as a 1 / 2 / 3-byte delta or absolute, which fields follow), far entities every other
  tick. Up to 10 fields per kind; the three most frequently changing ones belong in fields 1-3 (no ext byte).
  Players replicate their view angles at 9 + 7 bits. An entity is read and quantized once a tick for everyone,
  not once per client: `stageEntities` (in `Game.sendSnapshots`, before the client loop) copies the positions
  into typed arrays, `quant` runs the first time a client needs the entity that tick, and each client's
  `writeEntities` only diffs that staged copy against its own baseline. So what `quant` produces must not depend
  on who is looking, and code that changes an entity between two clients' snapshots has to restage it (the one
  case today, `writeSelf` rounding the viewer's own state, is handled in `writeEntities`). The staging arrays
  are allocated once; keep it that way. Every client's snapshot still walks every live entity, so the number of
  entities is what to keep an eye on (see Items on the ground below).
- **Global state**: all of it when anything but the clocks changed, otherwise just time / horde left once a
  second. **Events**: encoded once, filtered per client by radius / recipient; a shot carries no origin (the
  client uses the shooter's replicated position).
- `compression` stays off: permessage-deflate was measured at ~10% of the remaining payload, not worth the CPU.

## Many games on one server: the lobby

One process runs every game. The **network thread** (`server/index.js`) owns the sockets, the HTTP routes and the
leaderboard; **each game is a worker thread of its own** (`server/room-worker.js`: one `Game`, its own 20 Hz tick
loop, its own valley). So the games share the box's cores, generating a valley (a few hundred ms) in one game holds
up nobody else, and a game that crashes or runs out of its 512 MB heap ends alone: the network thread closes its
sockets (1011) and lets go of its records. `server/rooms.js` keeps them (`Lobby`, `Room`).

- **Codes and routing.** A game is known by its code: 6 characters for a public game, 10 for an invite-only one,
  from 32 that cannot be misread. `/ws?game=CODE` is that game; `/ws` with none is a quick join (`Lobby.quick`: the
  public game with the most people that has a seat, one in game over / victory last, else a new public game).
  The network thread answers a socket's first message (its JOIN) with `S2C.ROOM` (code, name, `ROOMF`) before
  passing it on, so the client knows its game - and its invite link - before WELCOME.
- **Seats are sockets.** A game is full when `maxPlayers` sockets are open in it; the network thread turns the
  next away itself (`REJECT_REASON.FULL`; an unknown code is `NO_GAME`). A socket that holds a seat for 15 s
  without joining is closed (`JOIN_WAIT` in room-worker.js), so idle sockets cannot keep a public game full.
- **Traffic between the threads** (`server/wire.js`): every message is a frame `[u16 slot][u32 length][bytes]`,
  packed with the rest of its batch into one ArrayBuffer that is transferred, not copied: socket messages go in
  once per turn of the event loop, a game's sends go out once per tick. A slot whose socket closed is only given
  to a new one once the worker says it is done with it (`'closed'`), so nothing meant for the old socket can reach
  the new. Backpressure crosses as a `SharedArrayBuffer` flag per slot: set by the network thread when a socket
  has over 256 KB unsent, read by the game through `conn.congested()` (it holds that client's snapshots back).
- **The leaderboard** (`PlayerStats`) stays on the network thread. A game's `records` is `RemoteRecords`, which
  posts enter / leave / bump with tokens; asked for the board (`C2S.BOARD`), the game posts who is asking and who
  is in the game and the network thread writes `S2C.BOARD` to the socket itself. The player id crosses to the
  network thread for `PlayerStats.enter` and goes nowhere else.
- **Lifecycle.** A game shuts down once it has been empty for 90 s (a reload, or a host getting the link out
  before joining, keeps it). Making a game: `POST /api/games` (JSON only, so a form on another site cannot).
- **Unlisted means unguessable.** Invite-only games are not in `/api/games` or `/status`. An address that asks for
  over 20 codes that do not exist (one more every 10 s) is told every code is missing for a while, the real ones
  included; an address may make 3 games in a row, then one a minute. `LOBBY_LIMITS=0` lifts both (load tests).
- **HTTP:** `GET /api/games` (the public games and what a new one can be), `GET /api/games/:code` (one game,
  invite-only too: the invite card), `POST /api/games` `{ name, host, inviteOnly, maxPlayers }`. `GET /status`
  has per-game tick timings and CPU (`load.cpuMs`: ms of CPU that game's thread used per second), the network
  thread's (`net`) and the process RSS; no codes.
- **Client:** `client/net/lobby.js` (the API, and invite links: `?game=CODE`; while in a game the address bar
  carries its link), the splash in `ui/menus.js` (Quick join, Browse games, Create game, or the invitation of the
  game whose link opened the page), `ui/games.js` (the Browse and Create panels), the invite link on the pause menu.
- **Capacity** (`npm run stress -- game|box`, scripts/stress.js; measured 2 Oct 2026 with bots at night 3 on a
  shared 11-core Mac, so read CPU ms per second, not wall-clock ticks): an 8-player game at night uses ~17 ms of
  CPU a second (45 in its worst second), ~62 MB of memory on a 70 MB base, ~2-2.6 KB/s down per player, and the
  network thread ~0.4 ms of CPU a second per player. A game levels off once its 120 zombies are all up (from
  ~24 players): 48 players in one game was 69 ms a second with a 7 ms tick p99. 64 games of 8 (512 players) ran
  with every game's tick p99 at 1.6 ms and every bot getting 20 snapshots a second. Memory runs out first, then
  the network thread (half a core at ~150 games): `defaultMaxGames` in rooms.js sizes `MAX_GAMES` from the memory
  the process may use (a container's limit when it has one) and caps it at 150. An emptied game builds its next
  valley only when someone joins it (`rollWhenEmpty: false`), not for nobody.

## The database: accounts, friends, messages, stats and match records

With `DATABASE_URL` set the server has a Postgres database (`server/db/index.js`: `pg` for a real server,
`pglite:<folder>` / `pglite:memory` for PGlite - Postgres in WebAssembly, in the process - in development and the
tests). **Only the network thread talks to it**; the games in their workers post what they have to say, as the
leaderboard always has. Without `DATABASE_URL` the server runs as it did before: no accounts, the leaderboard in a
JSON file (`server/stats.js`).

- **Migrations** (`server/db/migrate.js`, files in `server/db/migrations/NNN_name.sql`): applied in name order,
  each once (`schema_migrations`, with a checksum), all pending ones in one transaction under an advisory lock.
  The server migrates as it starts (`MIGRATE_ON_START=0`: not), and a production server whose migration fails
  exits, so that deploy never goes live; `npm run migrate` does the same by hand (and is the pre-deploy command in
  `railway.json`, which Railway has not been applying). An applied migration is never edited: a change is a new file. 001: accounts,
  sessions, `player_stats`, friends, messages. 002: the match tables. 003: the `analytics_*` functions.
- **Accounts** (`server/auth.js`): email + a name to play under (3-16 of letters, digits, `._-`, unique whatever
  the case) + a password (scrypt, node's crypto). Signing in is a random 32-byte token in an `HttpOnly`,
  `SameSite=Lax` cookie (`stn_session`, `Secure` behind https), its SHA-256 in `sessions`, 30 days from last use.
  `userForToken` caches what it found for a minute. Limits: 10 registrations an address then one per 5 min, 10
  sign-ins an address then one per 20 s, 8 wrong passwords an account then one a minute; an unknown account costs a
  scrypt too, and says no in the same words as a wrong password.
- **The API's plumbing** (`server/http.js`): `api(app, method, path, async (ctx, body) => ({ status, body, cookies }))`
  reads all it needs of uWS's request up front (it is only valid until the handler returns) and never writes to a
  response whose client went away. A POST must be JSON and, if it has an Origin, from this host - a page on another
  site cannot post with the player's cookie. The same Origin rule decides whether a WebSocket handshake's cookie is
  believed (`sessionToken` in index.js).
- **Playing signed in.** `/ws`'s upgrade looks the cookie up (async: the upgrade waits for it) and the socket's
  user data carries `{ id, name }`; `Room.attach` passes it to the worker (`{ t: 'open', user }`), `conn.user`, and
  `Game.handleJoin` makes the player's name the account's whatever the JOIN says, sets `p.account` (and
  `p.guestKey`, the SHA-256 of a guest's browser id) and tells everyone in the game who is signed in as what
  (`S2C.FRIENDS`: per player id the account name, '' for a guest), so the client can offer a friend request.
- **Stats** (`server/dbstats.js`, `DbStats`, the same face as `PlayerStats`): an account's under `u:<user id>`, a
  guest's under `g:<sha-256 of the browser id>`. The board's four stats are counted as they happen and written
  every 2 s, one upsert for everyone who scored; `board()` is async (Room.board answers when it comes back). Each
  stint of a match adds games, deaths, downs, headshots, boss kills, time and the furthest day
  (`addStint`, from the match store). Registering or signing in with `guestId` (the browser's leaderboard id) moves
  the guest record onto the account, and its match stints with it (`claimGuest`).
- **Friends and messages** (`server/social.js`): a request until accepted, then a friendship stored both ways round.
  Asking someone who asked you accepts them. A friend's presence is `playing` (with the game's info, **its code
  included even for an invite-only game: friends may join friends**, and nobody else learns it), `online` (a
  signed-in page open: its `/social` socket) or `offline` with when they were last seen. `Lobby.userIn/userOut`
  track which accounts are in which room; a change reaches their online friends as `{ t: 'friends', why:
  'presence' }`, coalesced over 400 ms. Messages are only between friends, 1-500 characters, 20 in a row then one
  every 1.5 s; each goes to both accounts' `/social` sockets. The socket only pushes; everything is also in the
  HTTP API, which the page asks again when it hears something changed. Signing out closes that browser's socket
  (4001).
- **Match records** (`server/analytics.js` in the game, `server/matchstore.js` on the network thread): a
  `MatchTracker` in each `Game` (only when the server has a database: `analytics` in the worker's options) turns
  what happens into records - `match`, `match_end`, a `player` per stint, a `night` per night, rare `event`s with
  positions (downs, deaths, revives, bosses, supplies found and installed, the engine...) and a `sample` every 30 s.
  The worker posts each (`{ t: 'an', rec }`); `MatchStore` queues them and writes once a second, one statement per
  table (`jsonb_to_recordset`), a match before what hangs off it, retrying a failed batch one row at a time; past
  50,000 queued it drops and says so. The hot paths (shots, hits, damage) only bump counters on the player's stint.
  A deploy's SIGTERM ends every match being played as `interrupted` and writes it (`Lobby.finishAll`, the worker's
  `finish`) before the process goes; a match a crash left open is closed once nothing was heard from it for 5
  minutes (`closeStale`: not at once, since on a deploy the old server is still playing its matches while the new
  one starts).
- **Client:** `client/net/account.js` (who is signed in, register / sign in / out; `guestId` is `playerId()`),
  `client/net/friends.js` (the `/social` socket with backoff, the friends list, requests, conversations, unread
  counts, `isFriendName`), `client/ui/account.js` (the account panel: sign in / create account, lifetime stats with
  ranks, the last games), `client/ui/friends.js` (requests, the signed-in players in this game to add, friends by
  presence with Chat and Join / Leave & join - which asks `/api/friends/:id/game` first, so it goes where they are
  now - and the conversation view). The splash has an account chip and locks the name field to the account's name;
  a message or request arriving in a game is a system line in the chat, nothing more. `S2C.FRIENDS` fills
  `conn.accounts` (player id -> account name) for the Tab-list star and "In this game".
- **Asking the records** (`003_analytics.sql`): `analytics_overview`, `_daily`, `_by_team_size`, `_night_funnel`,
  `_bosses`, `_death_causes`, `_damage_sources`, `_kills_by_type`, `_weapons`, `_supply_pacing`, `_retention`,
  `_server_health`, each a function of when to count from. `npm run report` (`scripts/analytics-report.js`:
  `--days`, `--since`, `--build <commit>`, `--only`, `--json`) prints them; each match carries the commit it was
  played on (`build`, from `RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`), so a balance change can be judged by the matches since.

## Rendering pipeline

- **Frame:** world -> `ScreenPasses` (`render/post.js`: SSAO, sun shafts, flashlight beam, applied in place into
  the MSAA scene target with one blended quad) -> eye-adaptation metering -> viewmodel -> bloom -> final pass
  (ACES, horror grade, grain, damage/infected vision) in `render/renderer.js`.
- **Quality presets** (`QUALITY` in `render/renderer.js`: low / medium / high / ultra) own every cost knob:
  pixel-ratio cap, MSAA, sun shadows (map size per cascade, range), which objects cast (foliage, characters,
  flashlight), SSAO, sun shafts, grass density, tree distance. Everything applies live on a settings change
  (`main.js applySettings` -> renderer, Environment.setShadows, Foliage.setQuality, Game.setShadowQuality).
  The render-scale setting multiplies the preset's pixel ratio.
- **Shader warm-up** (`Game.prewarm`): three.js builds a material's program the first time it is drawn and
  waits for it on the main thread, so nothing may be drawn for the first time during play. Behind the splash, and
  again for a new map or another quality, `GameRenderer.compilePrograms` starts every program of the world
  scene, the viewmodel scene and the post passes (`renderer.compile`: the driver builds them in the background)
  and `compileDepth` the shadow passes' depth programs; the frame loop draws nothing until the scene's are
  built; `Game.warmViews` meanwhile builds one of every view that only exists on demand (which also bakes the
  zombie rigs and the weapon and pickup meshes), and `Game.warmFrame` ends it with one frame nobody sees that
  draws one of everything. A player who joins sooner gets the rest in one go on the first frame, as before.
  The rule this buys: `renderer.info.programs.length` does not grow while playing. Anything new that is created
  on demand with a material of its own (an entity view, a lazily built effect) goes into `warmViews`; what is
  already in a scene, hidden or not, is covered.
- **Shared shader state:** `render/globals.js` must be imported first (main.js does). Its `G` uniforms (mist,
  key-light direction, fog sun colour, wind) are injected into every built-in material and every ShaderMaterial
  that merges `UniformsLib.fog` / `.lights`, BY REFERENCE (values survive three's per-material uniform clone).
  Update `.value` fields, never reassign them.
- **Fog:** globals.js replaces three's fog chunks: `scene.fog` (FogExp2) is still the distance haze and still
  bounds what must be drawn (`Environment.fogVisibility`); on top it adds a valley mist layer (analytic
  exponential height integral) and forward in-scattering towards the sun/moon. Custom ShaderMaterials only need
  `fog: true`, `UniformsLib.fog` merged and the fog chunks included. The sky shader inlines `FOG_FUNCS` so the
  horizon matches the fog.
- **Sun/moon:** three's cascaded `SunLight` (`three/addons/lights/SunLight.js`, 2 cascades in one atlas,
  texel-snapped, Vogel PCF) - it lights every built-in material like a DirectionalLight. Casters: terrain,
  static world, trees (+ bushes/rocks and characters on high/ultra), built structures. The static world's
  meshes do not cast themselves: each chunk has one shadow-only mesh per shadow side (`StaticWorld.casters`,
  reading the chunk's own vertex buffer) that the shadow passes draw instead; only materials whose texture cuts
  holes in the shadow (chain link, weeds, stencils) cast from their own mesh. The viewmodel scene has
  its own lights; `Game.updateViewmodelLight` rotates the key light into camera space and dims it by a
  ray/crown probe towards the light so hands are dark in shade. Those lights are about a quarter of the
  world's (no factor PI), so the weapon in the hands has its own material, the one Phong material
  (`getViewWeaponMaterial` in `render/models/skinning.js`): per weapon-atlas cell (`VM_SURFACE`) it lifts the
  dark gunmetal and polymer paint and sets the highlight strength, so metal shows its form while wood, tape
  and cloth stay matte. The arms and every world weapon (held by others, lying as pickups) stay Lambert on
  the paint as authored.
- **Time of day** is one palette table (`KEYS` in `render/environment.js`): colours, light levels, fog, mist,
  haze scatter, shaft strength and base exposure per sun height. Eye adaptation only compensates relative to
  `Environment.adaptRef` (the log-average luminance an open scene has at that light level), clamped 0.7-1.6x.
- **Weathered surfaces** (`SURF` + `surfacePatch` in `render/materials.js`): building surfaces and painted /
  galvanised props are a Lambert tile plus a normal map baked from the generator's height field
  (`getNormalMap`), and the weathering is NOT in the tile. The tile holds the bare material in RGB and a
  tileable wear field in alpha; the shader lays the coat (paint, rust or moss) over it where that field plus
  slow world-space noise crosses a threshold, then adds tonal drift, run-off streaks, damp stains, dust on
  upward faces, a sky sheen on gloss, and (static world) mud splash from `aGround`. So no wall or car repeats
  its damage. The static world lays wall UVs out in world space (courses line up across the pieces of a
  wall) and gives each painted building (`clapboard`, `barn`) one colour through `aTint`. Anything that moves
  uses the same materials without the world noise. `/sandbox/surfaces-test.html?set=walls|roofs|floors|cars`
  shows every surface through the real `StaticWorld`.
- **Look-dev:** `node scripts/lookdev.js --url <vite url> name:x,z,yaw,pitch,cycle[,flash] ...` screenshots the
  real game (server with `GODMODE=1 DEBUG_COMMANDS=1`) and prints uncapped fps, draw calls, triangles and the
  adapted exposure; `--debug 1|2` shows only the sun shafts / only the SSAO.

## Audio

- **Two layers.** Every sound has a procedural bank (`audio/synth*.js`, rendered in workers at start-up) and most
  now have a CC0 recording over it (`audio/samples/*.ogg`, table `REC` in `samples.js`: decode rate, `lazy`, and
  the `[start, dur, ...]` slice table of a multi-take sprite). A recording is used once it has decoded; until then,
  or for good if it fails to load, the procedural bank plays. `R_*` defs in `audio.js` bind a recording to a sound
  (`vol` is relative to the sound's own, calibrated against the procedural bank it replaces; `layer` keeps the bank
  underneath; `far` crossfades to a distant-perspective recording). To add one: drop the Ogg in `samples/`, add
  its `REC` entry and CREDITS.md row (CC0 only), point an `R_*` def at it.
- **Score** (`audio/music.js`): recorded stems crossfaded by game state over the generative score - menu theme,
  sparse daytime tones, night drone, a "dread" layer that follows the nearest zombie, the horde's taiko (muffled
  until something is close) and the boss theme, all in or around D minor. Each generative layer gives way to its
  stem once loaded. Stingers (`STINGERS` in `audio.js`) are recorded cues too, with the procedural ones behind them.
- **Zombie voices** are chosen on the client (`entities.js`): shambling zombies moan (`SOUND.ZOMBIE_MOAN`),
  hunting ones growl, each at its own stable pitch (`e.voice`, passed as `rate`); each carries a breathing loop
  (the engine only plays the nearest few); a kill is followed by the body hitting the ground (`SOUND.BODY_FALL`,
  `delay`). Special infected, dogs and bosses have their own recorded sets. Voices of the `zombie` category
  turn each other down as they pile up (`crowd` in `CATS`): a swarm must not out-shout gunfire or the music.
- **Master bus** (`_buildGraph`): 2:1 glue compressor -> limiter -> soft clipper -> master volume. Kept light on
  purpose: the quiet forest sits ~10 dB under automatic fire and nothing leaves above full scale.
- **Voice chat in the mix** (`VoiceSource`). WebRTC delivers a microphone at about -21 LUFS after Chrome's own gain
  control, some 9 dB under the game, so each voice goes through a leveller (a compressor: an 8 dB spread between
  microphones comes out as 2.5 dB) and the voice bus lifts it to about -12 LUFS within `VOICE_REF` (4 m), level with
  a pistol shot. It thins out gently past that (-7.5 dB at 15 m, -11 dB at `TALK_CLEAR`). While a voice is audible,
  `_duckTick` turns the music down 8 dB and effects + ambience 5 dB, scaled by how loud the voice reaches you; the
  "Lower game for voices" setting turns that off. Measured with a voice 2 m away (voice over the rest of the mix):
  day +14 dB, night +10, horde +7, under automatic fire -1 (it was +3, 0, -7 and -12.5 before).
- **Start-up.** The browser only allows audio after a user gesture, so `main.js` starts the engine on the first key
  or pointer press on the splash (the click on Join at the latest) and nothing waits for it: the join opens the
  socket straight away. Until `audio.ready` (about a second of bank rendering) a one-shot asked for is dropped and
  a loop is only queued, so the game can be in play before there is sound; ambience and music then come in from
  the state of that moment, and `main.js` plays the join stinger it could not play earlier.
- **Checking it without ears.** `/sandbox/audio-test.html` plays everything by hand (`?procedural` for the
  fallback); `?autotest` runs the engine's self-test (every recording decodes, loops are seamless, beds follow
  the state) and ends with `AUDIO_TEST_OK`. `node client/audio/selftest.js` checks the procedural banks.

## The mine: a second level under the heightfield

The valley is a heightfield, so everything about the ground is a function of (x, z). The workings under Blackrock
Mine (`shared/mine.js`, planned by `world.js` once every place stands) are a second level under it, and the rule
that keeps the two apart is in three functions of the world, so nothing that walks, falls, shoots or looks has to
know the mine is there:

- **`world.floorAt(x, z, y)`** is the ground under feet at height y: the terrain, or the floor of the drift they
  are down in. `groundAt` (collision.js) starts from it instead of `heightAt`, so the player simulation, zombies,
  cats, dropped items and thrown things land on the right level. `heightAt` stays the terrain alone: what grows,
  what is built on the surface and what the map shows use that. **Code that puts something on the ground at a
  known height must ask `floorAt(x, z, y)` or `groundAt(world, x, z, y)`; `heightAt` there puts it on the hillside
  above the drift.** (`groundAt(world, x, z, 200)` still means "the highest thing here": the surface.)
- **`world.rayTerrain`** treats the air of a drift as air and the rock round it as the hillside it is, so
  bullets, lines of sight, the flashlight test of the Shade and reach checks stop at the walls, the roof and the
  ground above without any colliders for the rock.
- **`resolveBody`** ends with `mine.confine`: a body below the ground beside a drift is pushed back off the rock
  (the planned distance field, `mine.sdf`: negative inside a drift). Players and zombies never get into the rock,
  so prediction needs nothing new.

The plan (`planMine`): the adit is at the back of the mine yard; the far portal goes to the best of a handful
of spots round every other place (dry, off the roads, clear of what is built there and of the roadside sites).
The main drift runs from one to the other by a dog-leg, the junction; its floor goes down each decline at
`DECLINE`, then as near under the ground as `COVER` allows, and deeper round the junction. Galleries leave the
level stretches and end in rooms. Two grids at 0.5 m are baked over all of it (distance to the rock, height of
the floor) and every query is a bilinear read of them. The terrain is only changed at the portals: a levelled
apron, a mound behind, and `COVER_MIN` of ground over every roof. Inside a portal (the first `PORTAL.HOLE`
metres of the decline, under its stone) the terrain is not drawn (the terrain shader discards it) and the
valley's nav grid is blocked.

- **The dead** (`server/minenav.js`): the valley's flow fields are one flat level, so the workings have a 1 m grid
  of their own with a distance field to whatever cell something is headed for. `Zombies.steerLevels` joins the
  two: a zombie on the surface after a survivor down there walks to the nearer mouth by the valley's field to the
  spot outside it, straight through, and on down the drift, and the other way round. Targeting and noise measure
  the walk round by a portal, not the few metres of rock between the levels (`MineNav.between`; `Zombies.noise`
  takes the height the noise was made at). The dwellers (`z.den`, one to a den of `world.mine.dens`, restocked at
  sunrise by `stockMine`) keep to the workings and go home when led out. No daylight gets down there: `isLit`
  never pins a Shade by day in the mine, and the horde that is down there at sunrise is `spared` until it comes up.
- **Drawing it** (`client/render/mine.js`): the rock is one mesh from the baked grids (floor and roof on the
  grid, walls on the zero contour, roughened into the rock only), with the timber sets and the track
  (`world.mine.frames`) drawn the same way and not as static-world parts. Their materials take the sun, the sky's
  light and the haze's glow by a per-vertex `aSky` (1 in a mouth, 0 well down a drift), so the adit shows black
  from the yard at noon. Everything else down there (zombies, props, items) is lit by the scene's lights, and
  those follow the eye: `Game.under` (0..1, how far down the eye is) fades the hemisphere light, the sun, the
  haze and the rain out in `Environment.update`. The water sheet only covers heightfield cells that dip below the
  water line, since a drift runs down through that level.
- **The strongbox** (`CONT.STRONGBOX`, one to a map, in the deepest room) is what makes the trip worth it. It is an
  ordinary container whose `CONT_DEFS` entry says more than a table: `also` (what is always in it), `loaded` (a
  weapon rolled from it comes with that many magazines, `loadedAmmo`), `once` (not refilled at sunrise) and
  `guide` (what the item tooltips call it). `Game.searchCache` and the item guide both read those, so another
  container can use them too.
- `scripts/test-mine.js` holds all of this on a dozen valleys and in a running game.

## Dark interiors: the wards of Mercy Clinic

The mine's rule, cut down to what a building needs: a place on the surface where it is dark at noon. The ward
wing of Mercy Clinic (`shared/clinic.js`, a place of the random pool) is the only one so far.

- **The rule** is a list on the world, `world.darks`: boxes (in a builder's frame, with a floor and a top), each
  with the mouth the day comes in by. `world.darkAt(x, y, z)` is 0 outside every box and, inside one, rises from 0
  `near` metres from the mouth to 1 at `far` (measured on the flat, a smoothstep): 1 m and 6.5 m, the length of the
  passage from reception, so the wards are wholly dark and the passage goes dark along its length. Server and
  client both ask it; nothing is on the wire.
- **The server** counts a point as in the dark from 0.5 (`WARD_DARK`, `Zombies.inDark`). `Zombies.isLit` gives no
  daylight to a Shade there (its one clause next to the mine's: torches, flares, fires and flashlights pin it as
  anywhere), and `Game.startDay` spares what of the horde stands there at sunrise (`z.spared`, as down the mine:
  it burns when it walks out into the day). The dwellers (`server/clinic.js`, `Wards`, owned by `Zombies`): one
  to a den of `world.clinic.dens` - three walkers by day, one crawling, and a Shade from the second day - restocked
  at sunrise unless a survivor is in the dark, spawned on their own random stream (it is swapped in for the
  game's while they are made). `z.ward` keeps them out of the day's wanderers and, with no one to chase, shuffles
  them between standing spots they have a clear walk to (`clinic.roam`), or takes them back to the hall by a flow
  field of their own when they were led out and left.
- **The client** does what it does down the mine. `Game.under` is the greater of how far down the mine the eye
  is and `darkAt` at the eye, so the sky's light, the sun and the haze go out as a survivor walks down the
  passage, smoothly (`Environment.update`). What is seen from inside is the lining (`clinic.lining`): floor,
  ceiling, the inner face of every wall and the partitions, boxes that world generation takes back out of
  `world.parts` and `client/render/clinic.js` draws with the material of the mine's rock (`material` / `mesh`,
  exported from `render/mine.js`), each vertex taking as much of the day as `darkAt` leaves there. So from
  reception the passage falls away into black, while reception keeps its daylight. The shell of the wing (outer
  walls, boarded windows, roof) is static world as usual: it is lit like any building from outside.
- **What it costs in layout.** No doorway in the wards is in line with the passage, so nothing in them is seen
  from the daylight (zombies and props there are lit by the scene's lights, which follow the eye: from the mouth
  of the passage a walker coming down it is lit as in reception - the mine's rough edge, and here only along the
  passage). Looking back from deep in the passage, reception is as dim as the eye's light makes it. Every doorway
  of the clinic is 1.6 m wide: the place is turned to face its road, and a 1.2-1.3 m doorway in a wall that runs
  askew to the nav grid's 1 m cells has, one map in ten, no cell-to-cell step through it, which closed the wards
  to the horde. `scripts/test-clinic.js` holds the rule, the dead and the drug locker on five valleys and in a
  running game.

## St. Agnes Cemetery: the dead come up out of the ground

- **The place** (`shared/cemetery.js`, `buildCemetery`) is part of the chapel's: the chapel's builder calls it, so
  it is on every map, and `PLACES` gives the chapel a 40 m yard for it (its back gate moved to the right-hand side).
  It has its own random stream. Its railings are parts with no collider of their own plus one `COL.STATIC |
  COL.NOBULLET` box per panel: a body does not pass them, a bullet and a line of sight do, and the nav grid cuts the
  steps across them like any thin wall (the gateway and the two panels that are down stay open). Headstones are
  the `gravestone` / `grave_cross` props, thin enough not to block a nav cell; mounds, pits and the gravel path have
  no colliders. Everything stands on the terrain where it is (the far corners lie past the levelled yard).
  Loot and the casket (`CONT.CASKET`, table `crypt`) are `ZONE.CEMETERY`; the crypt's supply spot is the chapel's.
  `world.cemetery` holds the graves (`{ x, y, z, yaw }`: where one of the dead stands up, and which way it faces),
  `inside(x, z)` for the fenced ground, and what the field map draws.
- **The rule** (`server/cemetery.js`, `Game.cemetery`) is called from five places in `server/game.js` (a new run,
  sunrise, the start of each wave, the tick, `/cemetery`) and one in `Zombies.updateOne`. A wave that starts with a
  survivor within `CEMETERY.NEAR` takes `CEMETERY.SHARE` of its walkers and runners out of its queue into
  `Cemetery.pending`; until they are up they wait in a wave of their own that never starts by the clock
  (`Cemetery.share`, pushed onto `Game.waves`), so the horde the HUD counts does not change. Each is given a grave
  when its turn comes (`pick`: weighted to the graves nearest the survivors, `1 / (1 + d/6)^3`, none within
  `KEEP_OFF` of one, none that gave up its dead in the last `STIR + RISE + REST`). By day `RESTLESS` graves drawn
  at sunrise each wake for the first survivor within `WAKE`.
- **A rise** is `stir` (`EVT.GRAVE`, the grave's index: the warning) and `CEMETERY.STIR` later `rise`: an ordinary
  `Zombies.spawn` whose feet are put a body's height under the grass, `z.riseT = CEMETERY.RISE`. While `riseT > 0`
  `Zombies.updateOne` hands it to `Cemetery.climb`, which only raises it (`riseDepth`: two heaves) and holds
  `ZANIM.RISE`. Nothing else knows: the hitbox goes with `z.y`, so `raycastWorld` stops a shot at the terrain before
  it reaches what is still under it, and the client draws the zombie where it is replicated, the terrain covering
  the rest. `poseRise` (`characters.js`) is the body meanwhile: arms overhead, then hands on the grass, then a knee
  over the lip.
- **On the client** (`client/render/cemetery.js`, `Game.graves`): the broken earth of every grave is one
  `InstancedMesh`, in the scene from the moment the valley loads (warm-up), an instance scaled to nothing until its
  grave stirs. `EVT.GRAVE` plays `SOUND.GRAVE_STIR`, heaves that instance and spits dirt for `CEMETERY.STIR` (and
  shakes the camera through `Game.quake` within 12 m), then `SOUND.GRAVE_BURST`, a spray, and the grave stays
  broken for the run. Walking in through the railings is "Discovered · St. Agnes Cemetery"; the field map draws the
  railings and a cross for every grave, and names the cemetery once the chapel is known.
- `scripts/test-cemetery.js` holds the place on six valleys and the rule in a running game, including a scripted
  night inside a ring of walls built round the chapel.

## Deer: wildlife that can be hunted

The deer (`server/deer.js`, shared numbers in `shared/deer.js`, the view in `client/game/deer.js` and
`client/render/models/deer.js`) are an entity kind of their own, `ENT.DEER` (fields: position, yaw, a `DANIM` state,
the coat in the create), kept in `game.deer` - not a zombie type with a flag. That was the choice between two kinds of
work: a zombie type would have had every system that walks `game.zombies` skip it (the horde's size and waves and
what is left of it, the night summary, kill counts and the leaderboard, the killfeed, the dawn sun, what a noise draws,
the night themes, `/spawn`, the Shade's light test, the leg shots, the cat's fear, the client's dread music and voices),
now and in everything added later; an entity kind needs its own hit registration, history and death, which come down to
a few hooks into code that already exists:

- **Shots and blows.** `Combat.forTargets` hands a survivor's shots and swings the live deer along with the dead, so a
  deer is judged by the same lag-compensated trace: its position is in the 32-tick history (`Game.recordHistory`), and
  `Combat.hitbox` gives it `deerHitbox` - a body cylinder and a head sphere ahead of it, up on the neck or (`DANIM.GRAZE`)
  down in the grass, where the model carries it (`/sandbox/models-test.html?deer=grid&hit=1` prints the skull against
  it). `Combat.damageZombie` passes a hit on a deer to `Deer.damage` before anything zombie-only runs; `legZone` is
  for zombies only. Blasts (`Combat.explode`) and burning ground (`updateAreas`) call `Deer.blast` / `scorch`. The
  client's own-shot prediction (`Game.predictPellet`) tests the same shapes where the deer are drawn, and the view
  follows the zombie's sample ring and fading offset, so the picture the shooter aims at is the one the server rewinds to.
- **Death.** `Deer.kill` drops `DEER_LOOT` through `Game.dropItem` and leaves the body on the wire as `DANIM.DEAD` for
  `DEER.corpse` s; nothing is credited to anyone (no `zkills`, `credit`, `killfeed` or `nightStats`). The hit marker still
  shows the kill. On the client a removed dead deer joins the corpse list (`DANIM.DEAD` is `ZANIM.DEAD`'s number).
- **What they fear.** Every group looks round four times a second (`Deer.threat`): a survivor nearer than `DEER.notice`
  (the multipliers for crouching, lying downed and sprinting are the dead's from `Zombies.chooseTarget`; a survivor down
  the mine is not seen), one of the dead or a player-zombie nearer than `DEER.dread`. `Zombies.noise` hands every noise
  to `Deer.hear`. A bolt (`Deer.refuge`) looks for open woods `DEER.flee` m straight away from it, then at headings
  further round, and the group runs there by a flow field of its own (`nav.computeField('deer' + id, ...)`, one solve
  per bolt or drift) where the straight line is not clear. A group already running ignores what is behind it.
- **Getting about.** The body moves by the collision the dead use (`resolveBody` with `human = false`), never takes a
  step into deep water or a mine portal (`world.mine.inHole`), and a deer that is held up for 0.6 s stops pushing: a
  grazing one gives up that tuft, a running one takes a few strides to the side and then the field again, and after
  three of those it stops where it is. `scripts/test-deer.js` chases groups round the valley for half an hour of game
  time and counts the ticks spent pushing at something (under 0.1%).
- **Its own randomness.** Everything random in `deer.js` comes off `mulberry32(seed ^ 0xdee4)`, the scatter of the drops
  too (`game.rng` is swapped for the deer's stream around `dropItem`), so the game's stream - and `sim-smoke` - is the
  same with deer in the valley as without; the test counts the draws.
- **Numbers and traffic.** Groups: `DEER.groups` of `groupMin`-`groupMax`, `DEER.cap` in all; `Deer.dawn` (from
  `Game.startDay`) walks new groups in from the rim to replace what was hunted. A standing deer costs nothing on the wire
  and grazing deer stand most of the time; one that moves costs about 4-5 B an update at the half rate of anything
  past `LOD_NEAR`. `npm run bench:net` (seed 4242, 4 players): +81 B/s of payload per client in the half-minute standing at
  the car, where two groups in range were being moved about by the dead (+5% on the wire), +37 B/s roaming, +4 B/s
  in the night's fight; no new messages or packets. The server spends about 0.01 ms a tick on them.

## The fair: a ride in the player simulation

The Tri-County Fair (`ZONE.FAIR`, core) is built by `buildFair` in `shared/fair.js`, called from world.js like any
place, and returns `world.fair`: its frame, the generator and its fuel drum, the lamps (light for the Shade) and the
strings of bulbs. The rides' frames, platform and deck are ordinary static parts; what turns is drawn by the client.

- **One clock, in commands.** Both rides turn on one ride clock that only moves while the generator runs, counted in
  commands (`CMD_RATE` to a second), and `seatPos(fair, seat, t)` is where a rider's feet are in a seat (0-7 the
  wheel's gondolas, 8-15 the carousel's horses) when it reads t. A survivor in a seat carries their own reading of it
  in the simulated state: `ride` (seat + 1), `rideT`, `rideGo`. `simulatePlayer` asks `rideStep` at the start of a
  command (moves `rideT` on by one, or decides the rider is out: Space, any speed or air under them that something
  else gave them - a knock, a rope - or having turned) and while it holds them treats them like a pinned player, then
  `rideCarry` puts the body in the seat (crouched height and eye, still, on the ground). That is all prediction needs:
  client and server run the same commands over the same numbers. The server only changes the three fields when the
  client cannot know: boarding (`ACT.RIDE`, `Fair.board`), the generator starting or stopping under riders
  (`Fair.turn`), and a rider whose reading has drifted more than half a second off the wheel's (`DRIFT`: their
  commands stopped coming, or the server dropped some). They travel as the self state's `SELF.RIDE` chunk.
- **The server** (`server/fair.js`, `Game.fair`) owns the wheel's clock (3 commands a tick while it runs), the fuel
  (in ticks) and the generator's rules: `HOLD.FAIR_START` / `FAIR_STOP` on `FAIR_GEN_ID` (a portion of
  the fuel the player carries, `state.ammo[AMMO.FUEL]`, if the tank is dry), `ACT.INTERACT` on `FAIR_TANK_ID` (a portion more), the
  standing noise (`NOISE.FAIR`, every `GEN.noiseEvery` s) and `Fair.lit`, the one call `Zombies.isLit` makes for it.
  The dead in a seat stay in it and go round with it until they rise. Everything a client draws comes from one entity,
  `ENT.FAIR`, in everyone's area of interest: running or not, and the clock and the fuel as server ticks they read zero
  at (`FRF`), so a running fair sends nothing. Which seat a player sits in rides in the top five bits of their
  entity's flags (`PRIDE_SHIFT`).
- **The client** (`client/game/fair.js`, `Game.fair`; meshes in `client/render/fair.js`) draws the whole fair at one
  reading of the clock per frame: a rider's own prediction (their seat must be under them), or for a player on foot
  the server's clock at the interpolation time moved on by the lead their own commands have on it, so that a seat
  being boarded is already where it will be. Every rider - other players too - is drawn in their seat at that reading
  (`Entities`: a player whose flags name a seat slides into it over a fifth of a second), so the ride and its riders
  can never come apart, whatever the link does. A step in that reading (the generator starting or stopping under a
  rider, a correction after a stall) fades out as an offset (`FADE`) instead of jumping. While seated the camera is
  the seat as drawn (`FairClient.carry`), `Prediction.viewLag` leaves rides alone, and [E] on "Get off" is the
  simulation's own jump, pressed for one command (`FairClient.press`).
- `scripts/test-fair.js` holds the rules against the server, and a rider's prediction against it on a laggy link.

## The railway

A single track across the valley from a tunnel in one rim to a tunnel in the other.

- **The course** is planned in `planLayout` (`shared/layout.js`) on a stream of its own (`seed ^ 0x7a11`), after
  Route 9 and the lake and before any place: it crosses Route 9 between the breakdown and the first stop of one
  arm, and each arm runs out to the rim drifting sideways by its own belly. The depot's spot and the stalled
  train's are picked with it; the line is then laid by its turn per metre, with no turn at all along the
  platform and the train (eased in and out), so it is dead straight there and never bends tighter than the
  curve it came from. Of the courses that pass (off the lake, clear of the breakdown, away from the highway for
  good, out through the rim at a fair angle) the one with the least digging is taken. Every other place keeps
  `RAIL_GAP` of woods between its levelled ground and the line, and the ponds keep off it. The depot is `core`
  and sited first (`site: 'rail'`).
- **The heights** (`planRail` in `shared/rail.js`): the raw ground along the line, less the rise of the rim,
  smoothed over a train's length and held to `RAIL.GRADE`; level at `RAIL.DROP` below the depot's yard through
  the depot, and level under the train. Every road meets it at the height of its bed (`pinRoad` in
  `buildRoad`), and the road router pays to run along it (`cost`), so roads cross it rather than follow it. It is
  never a wall to them.
- **The ground** (`grade`, after the roads are flattened in): every vertex within `RAIL.BED` of the centre line
  is set to the bed, and beyond that the ground is clamped to a slope of `RAIL.SLOPE` up or down from it -
  cuttings and embankments. In a bore the bed is wider and the sides steep, under the portal's stone. The bed is
  entered in the road grids as `ROAD.RAIL`, so nothing grows or is built on it and its ground is drawn as a dirt
  road. The heightfield has a point every 2 m, so only about the middle 3 m of the bed is level to the
  centimetre (under the sleepers); the ballast is drawn over the edges. The mine is planned after this, and its
  portals' aprons and the ground it heaps over a thin roof may move the edge of the bed; `settle` puts the bed
  back unless a roof under it needs that ground, and then the track rides over the hump at its ruling grade
  (`rail.humps` counts the vertices kept up: none in 300 valleys tested).
- **Standing on it.** Rails and sleepers are drawn by `client/render/railway.js` and have no collider: the line
  is open ground to bodies and to the nav grid. What stands above the ground to be walked on - the depot's
  platform, the loading dock beside the train, the floors of the two open boxcars - are thin slabs, which the
  nav grid takes as decks (as it takes the pier). They lie level with each other at `RAIL.FLOOR` over the bed,
  and the ground beside them (the depot's yard, the loading bank) is `RAIL.DROP` over it, a step below, so the
  dead walk up onto them; the drop to the bed is a deck's edge. `rail.decks` puts them in `world.floorAt` where
  they stand more than a step over the ground, so what is built, dropped or burnt in a boxcar is on its floor.
  `nav.js` keeps a deck's cut edges in the steps it tests against the real walls (`_deckStep`): beside the car
  the dead would otherwise be sent up the side of the dock. A doorway's jamb can still hold one up for a while:
  the field cuts the corner a body cannot, and it sidesteps until free.
- **The train and the depot** are static-world parts and props (`build`, on its own stream `seed ^ 0x7a12`):
  each car stands on the chord between its ends. A moving train would need none of this changed: the track is
  a polyline with heights a metre apart (`rail.main`), and the stalled train and the cave-ins are what would be
  in its way.
- `scripts/test-rail.js` holds the plan on any number of seeds (`--sweep`), and the bed, the tunnels, the
  boxcars, the dead and a running game on six.

- **Handcars** (`shared/handcar.js`): a flat car with a see-saw pump lever, one or two to a valley
  (`handcars(world)`): beside the depot's platform and 9 m off the Route 9 crossing, or at the end of the train,
  on stretches of open line of `HANDCAR.minRun` or more. The train cuts the main line in two and a car never
  passes it, or the cave-in of a tunnel; two cars on one stretch run into each other. A survivor on a car carries
  it in the simulated state as a rider at the fair carries a seat: `cart` (car + 1), `cartS` (its point of
  `rail.main`, fractional) and `cartV` (m/s along the line). `cartStep` at the start of a command works the lever
  (W / S drive it towards or away from where the rider looks along the line, Shift harder on stamina, `rollCar`)
  or takes them off (Space - [E] is sent as Space, `HandcarClient.press` - with the car's speed, over the side
  they look to; any speed or air that something else gave them, going down, turning); while the lever is worked
  `LEVER_HANDS` (fire, sights, reload) are masked out of the command. `cartCarry` stands the body on the deck behind
  the lever. The fields travel in the self state's `SELF.RIDE` chunk with the fair's.
- **The server** (`server/handcar.js`, `Game.handcars`) keeps one `ENT.HANDCAR` a car (`HCF`: its point of the line
  in 1/32 m, who rides it; the car index in its create record), in everyone's area of interest. A ridden car follows
  its rider's state; an empty one rolls on by itself (`rollCar` with nobody on the lever) until it stops. What the
  rider's prediction cannot know is settled there and written into their state (a rebase, as a knockback is): two
  cars meeting (`meet`: they part at two half-lengths and share the speed they met at, giving a little back) and
  the dead on the line (`strike`: from 3 m/s up knocked aside for 9 damage per m/s, the car a little slower; a Tank
  or a boss stops it dead). `ACT.HANDCAR` gets on a free car in reach; `/handcar [n]` puts you on one.
- **The client** (`client/game/handcar.js`, `Game.handcar`; the model in `client/render/models/handcar.js`, its
  rattle `loop_handcar` in `client/audio/synth-handcar.js`) draws the car we ride where our prediction has it and
  every other at the interpolation time (its point of the line rides in the sample's pitch slot), with the lever
  geared to the distance rolled (`leverAngle`: a stroke every `HANDCAR.stroke` m) and the wheels turning; a player
  riding one is drawn on its deck. While we work the lever our hands on its bar replace the weapon in the view.
- `scripts/test-handcar.js` holds the placement on ten valleys, the rules against the server, and a rider's
  prediction on a laggy link.

## Gameplay systems (iteration 2)

- **No base.** Structures can be built anywhere (within 7 m of the builder). `STRUCT.DOOR` snaps into the
  doorways recorded by world generation (`world.openings`); campfires and workbenches are crafting stations
  (`STRUCT_DEFS[t].station`), recipes name the station they need (`RECIPES[i].station`) and optionally a
  schematic (`schem`, team-wide unlock bitmask in the global state).
- **Crafting in bulk** (Shift / Ctrl+click a recipe) is not in the protocol: it is `ACT.CRAFT` sent n times. The
  server refuses each craft it cannot do with a toast, so the client counts first: `craftRun` in
  `client/game/bulkcraft.js` repeats the checks of `Game.craft` and the slot rules of `server/inventory.js` on a
  copy of the inventory (and, stricter than the server, only counts ammunition while a whole batch fits the
  reserve). `sim-smoke` holds it against the server, so change the two together. The inventory screen replays
  the crafts still on their way before it counts again (`Inventory._model`), the repeats leave through a bucket
  in `Game.sendCrafts` (the server drops what a client sends past 200 messages a second), and a listener plays
  one craft sound per 0.1 s however many `SOUND.CRAFT` events a tick brings.
- **Salvage** (`ACT.SALVAGE`: u8 from, u16 count) tears something down for the materials `SALVAGE` in defs lists:
  `from` is a backpack index, `SALVAGE_FROM.WEAPON` + a weapon slot, or `SALVAGE_FROM.ARMOR` (`Game.salvage`). A
  gun's magazine goes back into the reserve as rounds; what does not fit is dropped at the survivor's feet. The table
  gives back less than any recipe takes, so crafting and salvaging never loop into a gain (`test-salvage` holds it).
  Because the starting pistol, knife and hammer are worth something torn down, a leaver's parked kit records which
  of them they still had (`parkKit`'s `tools`), and a rejoin brings back only those.
- **Unequip** (`ACT.UNEQUIP`: u8 weapon slot, u8 backpack index, 255 = the first free one) puts a weapon from its slot
  into the backpack with its magazine (`Game.unequip`): a click on it in the Equipment panel, or a drag onto the grid.
  Onto a weapon for the same slot it is `useItem`'s swap; a full backpack leaves it where it is. `test-unequip`.
- **Ammunition** is not in the backpack: `state.ammo` (a reserve per `AMMO` calibre, up to `AMMO_MAX`) is the
  server's record, the simulation reloads from it and the client predicts it. `Game.giveItem` puts a cat `ammo` item
  there and returns what fit, so a full reserve leaves the rest lying; nothing ever puts one into `p.inv`. The
  mounted gun's belt and both generators draw from it too. `ACT.DROP_AMMO` (u8 calibre, u16 count, 0 = all) puts
  rounds on the ground from the inventory's Ammunition panel (Half / All); the client hears of the smaller reserve
  in its next snapshot, as it does of a pickup.
- **The backpack grid** is always `INVENTORY_MAX` (34) slots long, on the server, on the wire (`S2C.INVENTORY`,
  which ends with the worn backpack's byte) and in the inventory screen; only the first `invCap(p)` are open:
  `INVENTORY_SIZE` (24), and `BACKPACK_SLOTS` (10) more while a Backpack is worn (`p.backpackItem`, beside
  `p.armorItem`). Everything in `server/inventory.js` that puts something in a slot takes that cap (it defaults to
  24, so a call that forgets it cannot fill a locked slot), as do the swap / split bounds and `craftRun`'s copy.
  The backpack does not come off (`ACT.WORN`) while a slot past 24 holds anything, so the locked slots stay empty.
  Worn, it sets `PFLAG.BACKPACK`, and the third-person survivor carries the item's own model on its back.
  The Sort button (`ACT.SORT_INV`, `sortInventory`) merges each item's stacks and orders the open slots by
  `BAG_TIER` (defs.js), then item id and size: deterministic, and the locked slots are never touched.
- **The escape.** `SUPPLIES`/`SUPPLY_NEED` in defs; the server hides each supply at one of the candidate
  places' `world.partSpots` every game and replicates the rumoured zones (`global.hints`). Installing all
  of them enables the engine hold-interaction, which starts the final stand (`game.escape`). The stand is
  sized from the night of the same number (`hordeSize()` × `FINAL_STAND_SIZE`, the `FINAL_STAND_*` constants
  in `server/game.js`) and re-read from the survivors still alive whenever a group is due; wanderers near a
  survivor join it and count, the rest are removed as at nightfall, and the day's upkeep stops for its length.
  The warm-up (`Game.updateEscape`) only counts down while a survivor on their feet is within `ESCAPE_RADIUS`
  of the car; otherwise it stalls where it is, and the stand keeps coming on its own clock. A warm engine ends
  nothing: a survivor at the car holds [E] (`HOLD.DRIVE`, `ESCAPE_DRIVE_TIME`, the same path and reach as the
  engine-start hold) and `driveOff()` is the victory, for everyone; until then groups keep coming at
  `ESCAPE_LINGER_PACE` of the stand's pace. Two bits of the global state's flags byte carry "stalled" and
  "somebody is getting in" to the HUD, and the client holds its own countdown on a stall. The end screen
  tells each player whether they were within `ESCAPE_RADIUS` when the car left (client side).
  A supply cannot be lost on the way to the car: whatever drops an item (a death, [G], a full backpack, a
  disconnect, loot) calls `Game.dropItem`, which only lets it come to rest where a survivor can pick it up
  again - never on the lake bed off the pier, inside a wall or beyond the edge of the map.
- **Night waves.** `startNight()` builds `NIGHT_WAVES` queues; groups spawn 58-84 m around a random
  survivor (`Zombies.pickSpawnAround`). The horde never targets structures or a fixed point - only people.
  The picker passes over a spot a survivor would watch them appear at (`spawnExposure`: a clear ray from a
  survivor's eyes to head height at the spot, or 4 m to either side of it since a group is scattered that far),
  out to `sightRange()`: the distance the client's haze hides things at for the hour on the phase clock (about
  200 m at noon, 58 m in the dark, so a dark night's spawn band is all cover; the fog keyframes are copied from
  `client/render/environment.js`, the weather is client-only and left out). After 18 candidates it settles for
  one with only its middle hidden, then for the farthest one nobody is facing (`spawnsScreened`, `spawnsInView`
  count those). Rays stop at trunks, walls and terrain; foliage is not modelled. Used by the night waves, the
  final stand, the car-alarm fallback and the straggler teleport.
  Every night's boss (`bossPending`, drawn by `nightBoss(seed, night)` in `shared/nights.js` from `BOSS_POOL`; night 1
  is always The Brute) comes in with wave `BOSS_WAVE`; `Game.spawnBosses` scales its health by `BOSS_HP_PER_PLAYER`
  and `BOSS_HP_PER_NIGHT` (a Tank by `TANK_BOSS_HP` as well). The client draws the same boss from the seed
  (`nightBossText` in `client/ui/hud2.js`) and names it, with the def's `tip`, on the dawn card and at the dusk horn;
  `NOTIFY.BOSS` says when it arrives. A day's length is `dayLength(day)` in `shared/constants.js` (`Game.dayLen`):
  long on days 1 and 2, then `DAY_SHRINK` shorter each day down to `DAY_LENGTH`. A boss drops its loot (`bossLoot`, default 8 rolls) only if it dies before
  the dawn sun sets it alight (`z.onFire`, `Combat.killZombie`); the sun's kill goes to the killfeed as `KILLER.WORLD`.
  The horde takes one new kind a night: `startNight` zeroes the weight of every kind whose `ZOMBIE_DEFS[t].minNight`
  is still to come, and puts the night's new one in the second wave if the draw left it out. By day the kinds are not
  gated by night but by distance from the car (`Zombies.daySpecial`, `DAY_SPECIAL_*`).
- **Noise.** `Zombies.noise(x, z, loud)` is the one entry point: `loud` is the radius (m) the noise carries
  (`NOISE` in constants.js; gunshots use `WEAPONS[w].noise`). Every zombie inside it with no target heads for
  the spot (`alertX/Z`, `alertT`), at a speed set by how loud it was where the zombie stood (`alertRush`,
  `NOISE_RUSH`); a much fainter noise does not replace the one it is heading for (`alertLvl`). Anything that
  should draw the dead (a new weapon, explosive or loud interaction) calls it next to its `game.sound`.
- **Light and the Shade.** `ZTYPE.SHADE` (`ZOMBIE_DEFS[t].shade`) only moves in darkness. Every tick
  `Zombies.isLit` asks whether light reaches it: it is day, it stands within the `light` radius of a burning
  torch / campfire (`STRUCT_DEFS`), a road flare (`THROWABLES`) or a molotov fire, or it is inside a survivor's
  flashlight cone (`FLASHLIGHT_RANGE`, `FLASHLIGHT_CONE`) - each with a clear ray to its head, chest or shins,
  so walls, trees and terrain cast shadows. While lit (`z.lit`) it holds still with `ZANIM.FROZEN`, takes
  `litResist` x damage and no knockback (`Combat.damageZombie`); the client keeps the pose it was caught in
  (`ZombieInstance.hold`) and plays the freeze / release sounds from the replicated anim, with no extra traffic.
- **Power: the generator and its floodlights** (`STRUCT.GENERATOR` 11, `STRUCT.FLOODLIGHT` 12; numbers and the cone in
  `shared/power.js`, the rule in `server/power.js`, the client in `client/game/power.js`). Both are ordinary structures
  (they block, the dead break them, they count to `MAX_STRUCTURES`); everything else hangs off three hooks in
  `server/game.js`: `Power.update` at the top of `updateStructures`, `Power.interact` in `interact` and
  `ACT.GEN_SWITCH` (u16 entity id) in `handleAction`. A generator's tank is `e.burnLeft` (seconds) and its switch
  `e.off`; it runs while the switch is on and there is fuel. Each tick `Power.update` burns the fuel of the running ones,
  raises their hum through `Zombies.noise` every `GEN_HUM_EVERY` (with `game.rng` swapped for the module's own stream
  for the call: the noise scatters where each zombie heads, and a generator must not shift what the rest of a seeded
  run rolls), powers every floodlight within `GEN_RANGE` of a running one and lists the powered cones (lens and axis
  from `floodAim`). `Zombies.isLit` asks `Power.floodLit` (one line, between the point lights and the flashlights): the
  zombie's head, chest or shins inside a cone (`inFloodCone`, allowing for the body's width, like the flashlight)
  with a clear line from the lens (`Zombies.clearLine`, so walls, trees and terrain cast shadows). The lens sits ahead
  of the stand's own collider so that line never starts inside it. On the wire nothing is new: the state byte
  (`SF.STATE`) of a generator is the switch in bit 0 and the fuel in 5 s steps above it (`genState`), of a floodlight 1
  while powered. The client draws from that byte alone (`PowerViews`): the drone loop, the shake and the exhaust of a
  running generator; a floodlight's lens, glare (shrinking off-axis and in haze) and a beam (an additive cone whose
  silhouette fades out, dimmed by the haze instead of tinted, since fog would paint an additive cone the haze's
  colour). The light itself is a pool of `FLOOD_SPOTS` (3) shadowless spot lights created with the game, like
  `render/lights.js`, given each frame to the nearest lit floodlights within `SPOT_REACH`: a fourth lit lamp further
  off keeps its lens, glare and beam and lights nothing. The spot is shaped to the rule (a little wider than
  `FLOOD_HALF`, a soft edge, a slightly negative decay so the ground the lamp grazes 20 m out still shows the cone).
  `[E]` on a generator is decided on the client: a press under `GEN_HOLD` is a tap (`ACT.INTERACT`: pour), held past it
  `ACT.GEN_SWITCH` goes; the item guide counts `STRUCT_DEFS[t].fuel` as a use of that fuel.
  `scripts/test-power.js` holds the rule on any seed.
- **Bats and walls.** Bats fly (`Zombies.updateBat`), and what stops the dead on foot stops them in the air:
  after each tick's flight `flyCollide` puts a bat back outside whatever solid thing it overlaps (static
  colliders, player structures, and `roofBoxes`: every `world.roofs` entry as a block from eaves to ridge,
  because gable roofs and shelter tops are drawn without a collider), on the side it came in from, so it slides
  along a wall or over a roof. They do not use the flow fields. A bat held up on its way to a survivor is shut
  out (`BAT_SHUT_OUT`): it wheels round them, a tight pass over the roofs and then a wider one at window height,
  looks for a clear line every third tick (`batSees`) and comes straight down the first one it gets - a doorway,
  a window, the top of a wall with no roof over it, or the survivor stepping outside.
- **Fire and burning.** `Combat.ignite(z, attacker, weapon, time)` gives a zombie the burn status (`BURN` in
  defs.js; `z.burnT` seconds left, `z.burnBy` / `z.burnWeapon` for the kill). `Zombies.updateOne` ticks it
  through `damageZombie` with `{ fire, dot }` (`fire`: burnt corpse, no loot; `dot`: one small tick of a
  continuous hurt, so it rarely cries out). More fire tops the time back up, it never stacks. It is replicated as
  `ZSTATUS.BURNING` in the zombie's `ZF.STATUS` field (also set while the dawn sun burns the horde), which is all
  the client needs for the flames, the light and the crackle (`Entities.updateBurning`). Anything new that
  should set the dead alight calls `ignite`; the flamethrower and molotov fires do.
  The flamethrower (`WEAPONS[w].flame`) is an ordinary predicted auto weapon, its magazine the fuel tank.
  `Combat.fire` hands its shots to `Combat.flame`: a lag-compensated cone test with a wall check per target
  instead of a ray. Clients draw every `EVT.SHOT` of it as one puff of the stream (`Game.flamePuff` ->
  `Effects.flameJet`) and keep one roar loop per shooter alive while the puffs keep coming.
  `WEAPONS[w].bossMul` (the anti-tank rifle) multiplies a round's damage in `Combat.fire` when what it strikes is a
  boss or a Tank, after the head multiplier; the rounds after the first in a pierce lose 30% each as any gun's do.
- **The RPG** (`WEAPONS[ITEM.RPG].rocket`) is a predicted single-shot weapon like the crossbow (`autoReload`), but
  its shot is no ray: `Combat.fire` hands it to `Combat.launch`, which spawns a `PROJ.ROCKET` projectile from the
  eye along the shot's direction at `rocket.speed`, falling at `rocket.grav`. It is put as far along its flight at
  once as the shooter's own has flown by then: the age of the picture it was aimed at (`rewindTime`) less
  `INTERP_DELAY`, at most `ROCKET_AHEAD`. Its blast is an event, shown on arrival and not drawn behind, so it then
  reaches the shooter about when their grenade gets there. `updateProjectiles` tests each step against the world
  and the ground (`rocketStrikesWorld` in shared/rocket.js, which the client uses too) and the hitboxes of what the
  shooter can damage (`forTargets`, where they are now), and on the first of them, or `range` metres out,
  calls `Combat.explode` with `{ zombies: damage, mark }`: the pipe bomb's blast, plus a hit marker for the shooter.
  Others see the replicated projectile (`Entities`: nose along its flight, `Effects.rocketTrail`, the `rocket`
  loop) and the backblast from `EVT.SHOT`. The shooter's own is not drawn from the wire: `client/game/rockets.js`
  flies it from the moment of the shot with the same numbers, drawn off the muzzle and closing onto the line of
  flight, and ends it where it strikes the world or the dead as drawn, or at a server `EVT.EXPLOSION` on its line of
  flight (its trail drawn on to the blast).
  `scripts/test-rpg.js` holds it against the server.
- **Legs.** `ZOMBIE_DEFS[t].legs` marks what walks on two; the numbers are `LEG_*`, `STUMBLE_*`, `HOBBLE_SPEED`
  and `CRAWL_*` in constants.js. `Combat.fire` calls a hit on the body cylinder below `LEG_ZONE` of the zombie's
  height a leg hit (`legZone`; the left or right leg by which side of the body it struck) and hands it to
  `Combat.hitLeg`: the leg's own health (`z.legHp`, `LEG_HP` of the zombie's) takes all of it, the body
  `LEG_BODY_DAMAGE` of it, and the zombie trips (`z.stumbleT`, `ZANIM.STUMBLE`: slowed, its swing cancelled). A
  leg worn through sets its bit in `z.legs`, replicated as the `ZF.LEGS` field, and sends `EVT.ZOMBIE_LEG` once for
  the piece that flies off. `Zombies.updateOne` hobbles on one leg (`HOBBLE_SPEED`) and crawls on none
  (`crawlSpeed`): a crawler starts no special, turns slowly, reaches and sees from `CRAWL_HEIGHT`, and
  `Combat.hitbox` gives it a low cylinder with the head `CRAWL_HEAD_FWD` ahead, as for a quadruped. Only bullets do
  this: blades, fire and blasts hurt the body as before. On the client the field drives the model
  (`ZombieInstance.setLegs`: the shin bone is scaled away and the stump bone under the thigh shown, the way a shot-off
  head is) and the pose: `poseStumble`, `poseHobble` (one hop per cycle of the phase, the ankle placed and the leg
  fitted to it so the planted foot stays put), `poseCrawl` (prone, every animation state played from the ground; it
  puts the head where the server's hitbox has it, and bends each elbow until the hand is on the ground). The event
  only throws the gib (`Effects.gibLeg`, a piece from the limb pool the overkill gibs use), so a client that was
  not there still sees the right model. `scripts/e2e-legs.js` runs it in the real client; the sandbox's
  `?film=0&legs=3` prints where the head ends up, which is what `CRAWL_HEAD_Y` / `CRAWL_HEAD_FWD` are set from.
- **The mounted gun** (`shared/mountedgun.js`, `server/mountedgun.js`, `client/game/mountedgun.js`, the models in
  `client/render/models/mountedgun.js`). The nest is a prop of the Army Checkpoint (`mg_tripod`, found by
  `gunNest`); the gun on it is one entity, `ENT.GUN` (belt, gunner, where it was left pointing), made by
  `startGame`. Manning it is `ACT.GUN_MAN`, feeding the belt `ACT.GUN_FEED`; neither touches the player simulation,
  so the gunner walks as ever, and letting go is stepping away (`atGrips`, checked by the server every tick and by
  the gunner's own client). It is fired by commands like a gun in the hands, but not by the simulation: while
  manning, the client puts the fire button into its commands as `BTN.GUN` instead of `BTN.ATTACK` (so the weapon
  in the hands stays quiet), and both ends run `stepGun` over the gunner's commands - the server in
  `processInputs` after each one is simulated, the client over the commands each frame's prediction step issued -
  so the client draws a round on the command the server fires it on. A round is `gunShot`: from the gunner's eye
  along their view held inside the arc, through `Combat.fire` with the gun's own row (`ev.def`, `GUN`), so it is
  rewound, pierces and scores like any other. Remote clients draw it from the muzzle (`EVT.SHOT` with
  `MOUNTED_GUN`, id 16, which no item has); the gun turns with the gunner's replicated view, so it costs no
  traffic while it swivels. The gunner's client keeps its own count of the belt while its rounds are in flight
  and takes the server's once they have all landed.
- **Reach.** Nothing at arm's length goes through a wall. A survivor's hands (search, revive, pick up) and blade
  (`Combat.meleeClear`) use `canReach` in collision.js: over cover no taller than eye height (barricades, sills,
  fences), through what survivors walk through (gates, door boards). The AI dead (`Zombies.canReach`) and a
  player-zombie's claws need a clear chest-to-chest line, so a barricade stops them too. Melee tests its
  candidates nearest first and stops at the first it can hit: a ray or two per swing, not one per zombie in reach.
- **Containers** are `ENT.CACHE` entities (position + searched state) created from `world.containers`;
  searching is a server-side hold interaction (`ACT.HOLD_BEGIN/END`, progress in the self state).
- **Interaction reach.** The `[E]` prompt comes from `Entities.pick`: the view ray, `INTERACT_REACH` long, has to
  pass within a pick radius of the target (`PICK_RADIUS`, `structPickRadius`). The server takes its distance limits
  from the same constants (`Game.reachOf`) plus `INTERACT_SLACK`, because it handles an action on arrival while
  the commands that moved the player there are still queued; a hold under way is broken off `HOLD_SLACK` further
  out. A refusal is silent, so the server must never be stricter than the prompt: something new to interact with
  needs its radius in both `pick` and `reachOf`. sim-smoke takes each action from the edge of its prompt.
  The target already picked keeps `PICK_STICK` (x1.15) of its radius, so a crosshair on its edge does not flick
  the prompt on and off; that is far inside `INTERACT_SLACK`.
- **Interaction highlight** (`client/game/highlight.js`, `Game.highlight`, the "Interaction highlight" setting:
  off / subtle / strong). A faint outline on `Game.lookTarget` while the prompt offers `[E]` or `[X]`, nothing
  else: info-only prompts get none, and the glints stay the long-range cue (the outlined thing's glint goes out).
  It is an inverted hull: every solid mesh of the target gets a back-face shell pushed out a fixed number of
  pixels along normals smoothed by position, drawn depth-only and then in colour with `EqualDepth` so overlapping
  shells blend once. Two draws per mesh while something is outlined and none otherwise; no stencil, depth
  texture or extra pass, so Low and PS1 mode get it too (it snaps to the PS1 grid). Brightness is divided by the
  exposure, so it reads the same by day and night. Containers, the radio, the car, the fair's generator and
  drum are merged into the static world, so their shells come from a stand-in built from the same prop
  (`createProp`) where world gen put it; a wreck's trunk outlines the wreck; the bell rope is rebuilt from its
  world-gen cylinders. A new kind of [E] target needs a case in `Highlight.targetObject`.
- **Harvesting** is a melee swing that hits nobody: `Combat.melee` then traces the world to the weapon's range
  + 0.3 m and hands a tree (`COL.TREE`) or a wreck (`COL.SALVAGE`: props marked `salvage`) to `Game.gatherHit`
  (6 / 5 hits each, refilled at dawn). The sixth hit fells a tree (`Game.fellTree`, `shared/felling.js`): its
  collider leaves the static grid on the server and, by `EVT.FELL` (and `EVT.STRIPPED` for a late joiner), on
  every client, until `EVT.REGROWN` puts them all back; the client hides its instance and `render/fallingtrees.js`
  tips a copy over to land at `FALL_T`, where `SOUND.TREE_FALL`'s crash sits, then dithers it out. The client
  knows none of the hit counts; `client/game/harvest.js` repeats the
  trace and the yields for the interaction prompt ("[LMB] Chop for Sticks and Planks") and for the "Need 2 more
  Planks" lines of a refused build or craft (the server only sends `NOTIFY.NOT_ENOUGH`). `sim-smoke` holds that
  file against the server's swing and yields, so change the two together.
- **Supply drops** (`spawnSupplyDrop`): the server picks a supply spot and a random heading, emits one
  `EVT.FLYOVER` (plane origin at release, heading, eta; constants `PLANE_*` / `CRATE_*`) and PLANE_LEAD / PLANE_SPEED
  seconds later spawns the crate at the cargo ramp with the plane's speed: state 3 free fall, 0 under the canopy
  (it sheds the forward speed and lands exactly on the spot), 1 landed, 2 opened. The client (`render/flyover.js`)
  flies the plane model (`models/plane.js`), trails GPU-animated smoke puffs that linger ~2.5 min and drift with
  the wind, and plays the engine drone as a positional loop (speed-of-sound delay, doppler, air absorption).
  `/airdrop` (debug commands) calls one in. `flySupplyDrop(x, z, heading, y)` is the plane on its own, for a drop
  aimed at a spot (the Relay Station's radio, below); `y` is the height of the ground meant there.
- **Fixtures: the chapel bell and the Relay Station's radio** (`shared/fixtures.js`, `server/fixtures.js`,
  `client/game/fixtures.js`). Things in the world a survivor works with a hold [E] that are neither entities nor
  the car. Their interaction targets are `BELL_ID` / `RADIO_ID` (protocol.js, next to `CAR_ID`), sent with
  `ACT.HOLD_BEGIN` like any hold; `Game.holdBegin` / `updateHold` hand a hold on one of them to `Fixtures`
  (`owns`, `holdBegin`, `holdOk`, `holdDone`), and the kinds `HOLD.BELL` / `HOLD.RADIO` drive the progress ring.
  Where they are is a spot in their place's own frame (`BELL_ROPE`, `BELL_AT`, `RADIO_AT`; `fixtureSpots(world)`
  turns them into world positions); world.js builds the rope (a part of the chapel), the bell (prop
  `church_bell`, in an open belfry) and the radio (prop `radio_set`, under open sky beside the mast) at the same
  numbers, and `scripts/test-fixtures.js` holds the two together. Reach is an entity's: the client offers [E] when
  its view ray passes within `FIXTURE_PICK` of the spot inside `INTERACT_REACH` with nothing in the way
  (`canReach`), the server allows `FIXTURE_REACH`. A pull (`Fixtures.ringBell`) sends `NOTIFY.BELL` and the
  tolls follow from `Fixtures.update`: each is a `SOUND.BELL_TOLL` with no radius (everyone hears it; the `bell`
  category in audio.js carries it across the map) and a `Zombies.noise` of `NOISE.BELL`. A call
  (`Fixtures.callPlane`) spends `RADIO_BATTERIES`, aims `flySupplyDrop` at the caller (pushed a crate's width
  clear of whatever stands beside them, the heading off a stream of its own: the game's is not drawn from) and
  makes a `NOISE.RADIO`; `calledDay` keeps it to one a day, and `phase` to the day. The client keeps what it knows
  of both (the rope's wait, the day's call) from the notices, so its prompt can be out of date for a client that
  joined since; it sends the hold anyway, and the server answers a refusal with `NOTIFY.BELL_WAIT` /
  `NOTIFY.RADIO_NO` (reason in `RADIO_NO`). The item guide lists what a fixture costs (`FIXTURE_USES`) with the
  recipes. `/bell` and `/radio` (debug commands) ring it and go to it.
- **Waypoint and compass.** A click on the field map sets `Game.waypoint` (`MapScreen._pick`: a place's name or
  yard snaps to the place; the map frees the pointer while it is open, the way the inventory does),
  `Game.buildMarkers` shows it as a compass marker and a world marker, and it clears on arrival, with a new game
  and with the world. The team sees it: `Game.shareWaypoint` sends every change (set, moved, cleared, arrived) as
  `ACT.WAYPOINT`, the server keeps it as `p.waypoint` (taken whatever state the player is in, clamped to the map,
  an unknown place id dropped; `startGame` clears them all) and puts it in the player list behind `PLF.WAYPOINT`,
  so a late joiner gets everyone's with the list and a burst of clicks costs one list a tick. `Game.teamWaypoints`
  picks the ones to show - survivors see survivors' (downed too), turned players the turned - one per spot
  (`sameSpot`: a place, or bare spots within `WAYPOINT_REACH`); one on your own spot adds no flag but names its
  owners under yours (`mine`). They are `teamway` markers (teal, `--teamway`; ranked after teammates on the
  compass, not pinned to its ends), flags on the map named for their owners, and a toast when a teammate sets
  one. `Compass.update` (`ui/hud2.js`) lays the markers out in rank order (`RANK`, then the nearer one),
  each taking the room it needs: an icon that would touch one already placed stands aside by an icon's width
  without its text, or becomes a tick on the tape; a label that would touch another is pushed a little
  sideways or dropped; the marker you face (and always the waypoint) spells out its `name`. Label widths come
  from a canvas `measureText` cache, so the pass never reads layout, and the DOM is only written on change.
- **Talking.** Chat and voice reach `TALK_RANGE` (clear to `TALK_CLEAR`); beyond it a walkie-talkie link
  carries them (`radioLinked` in defs: both ends carry `ITEM.WALKIE`). Text is gated on the server:
  `handleChat` sends each recipient its own `S2C.CHAT` flags (`CHATF`: radio / faint / unheard). Voice is a
  peer-to-peer WebRTC mesh the server cannot gate, so the receiving client does it: `S2C.PLAYERS` carries who
  holds a walkie (`PLF.WALKIE`), and each `VoiceSource` in `audio.js` mixes a positional path with a band-limited
  radio path that takes over as the speaker leaves earshot (or the area of interest). The walkies themselves
  are `WALKIE_STASHES` extra items hidden in schematic-type containers by `startGame` on their own random
  stream (`cache.stash`), and never despawn once dropped.
- **Death lasts until dawn** (`DAWN_RETURN` in constants.js). A survivor who dies becomes a player-zombie
  (`killPlayer`, then `spawnPlayerZombie`). `startDay` calls `returnFallen`: every player who is dead or a zombie
  is a survivor again (`spawnHuman(p, RETURN_KIT, true)`), on the spot `pickJoinSpawn` picks beside the team as
  for a late joiner, and `NOTIFY.RETURNED` tells everyone who. It does nothing with nobody alive: `checkAllDead`
  ends the run on the death that leaves nobody standing, before the clock gets to dawn. The final stand stops the
  clock, so there is no dawn in it. `fallen` holds the names of players who left dead since the last sunrise: a
  rejoin under one of them is a player-zombie again (`handleJoin`), since a JOIN carries no identity but the name.
  At sunrise their parked kit in `leftKits` (empty: the dead dropped theirs) becomes `RETURN_KIT`, so a rejoin
  after it is a survivor with what the dead who stayed woke with.
- **Items on the ground.** Everything that puts an item down goes through `Game.dropItem`, which marks it a
  loose drop (`e.drop`). At most `MAX_DROPS` of them lie around: one more and the oldest despawns (`spawnItem`).
  Car supplies, schematics and walkie-talkies are permanent and not counted, loot points and hidden supplies are
  not drops. A survivor who dies drops all they carry (`dropAll`); one who leaves the game takes along what they
  were handed at the start (`p.kit`, recorded by `spawnHuman`) and drops only the rest (`parkKit`, see Joining a
  run in progress below), so a reconnect neither litters nor doubles the kit.
- **Coming and going.** `Game.admitJoin` gives each address (`conn.ip`, from `clientAddress` in `index.js`:
  behind a proxy it is the forwarded one) two lobbies' worth of joins at once and one more every `JOIN_EVERY`
  seconds; past that a join is refused as "server full". The "joined" / "left" chat lines have one allowance for
  everybody (`GREET_EVERY`): once it is used up players come and go unannounced, the player list still shows them.
- **Downed/revive** is part of the deterministic player state (`s.downed`: crawl speed, pistol only).
  What the rest of the team sees of a survivor needs no traffic of its own: their health is field 7 of the
  player entity (0..255, always in the area of interest), down / dead / turned is `PFLAG` and the status byte of
  `S2C.PLAYERS`. Nameplates, the compass and the survivors list read those (`Game.buildMarkers`,
  `Game.pushRoster`; the colour marks are `healthTier` in `ui/hud2.js`).
- **Joining a run in progress** (`Game.handleJoin`). `spawnHuman(p, kit, beside)` puts the newcomer down where
  `pickJoinSpawn` says: 2.5-9 m from the survivor with the most company, on a spot that is open on the nav grid, level
  with that teammate, dry, clear of every collider (`resolveBody`) and with a clear knee-high line to them
  (`Zombies.clearLine`) - the one furthest from the dead, out to 22 m if they are all over the nearer ground. It
  returns null (the car spawn) when nobody is alive or the team is within `TALK_CLEAR` of the car. The kit is
  `starterKit(day)`. A leaver's starting kit is not dropped: `parkKit` keeps what is left of it (never more than was
  issued) in `leftKits` by name, and a rejoin during the same run gets exactly that back, so reconnecting creates no
  supplies. Anything that brings a survivor back mid-run should call `spawnHuman` the same way.
- **The personal record** is client-side only: no server state, no traffic. `Game.trackRun` follows the replicated
  phase (not the NEW_GAME / VICTORY / GAME_OVER notifications: a client skipped for a tick loses its events) and
  records a run when it ends, if this client was in it from its first minute (`RUN_JOIN_GRACE`): outcome, nights,
  length in server ticks, the player's own kills since the run began, team size, seed. `client/ui/records.js`
  keeps the last 20 runs plus running totals and bests under `localStorage['stn.runs']` (format at the top of the
  file). Every read goes through `sanitizeRecord` - the stored value is never trusted - and a write that fails
  is kept in memory for as long as the page lives. `scripts/test-records.js` checks it.
- **Weather** is client-side only and adds no network traffic. `client/game/weather.js` derives a seeded
  schedule (fog banks, gales, rain, thunderstorms; weighted toward dusk and night, and the first evening always
  brings fog) from the world seed and the replicated phase clock (`phase`, `day`, `timeLeft`, `phaseLen`), so
  every client sees the same weather. Lightning strikes come from hashed 0.5 s slots of that clock, so they land
  at the same time and place for everyone; each listener hears the thunder after its own distance delay. The
  renderer reads `weather.state` for fog density (and the valley mist), the overcast deck (no sun shafts),
  lightning light, wind (`Foliage.update` drives `G.uWind`: trees bend trunk and crown together, grass and bushes
  lean; the ambience plays the same wind), ground mist, the flashlight beam's haze (post.js, denser in rain), and
  rain streaks and splashes (`render/weatherfx.js`, kept out from under `world.roofs`).
- **Item guide** (`client/game/itemguide.js`): the "Used in" and "Found in" lines of the inventory's tooltips are
  derived at load from `RECIPES`, `STRUCT_DEFS`, the loot tables (`CONT_TABLES`, `LOOT_TABLES`, `ZOMBIE_LOOT`,
  `SPECIAL_LOOT`) and `PLACES`, so a new recipe, item or table needs no text written for it. The one thing it
  repeats by hand is `GATHER`, what a hit on a tree or a wreck gives (`Game.gatherHit`): change the two together.
  `scripts/test-itemguide.js` holds every line against the tables, generated worlds (which place tables are
  rolled at all) and the server's gathering. Supply-drop loot (`CRATE_TABLE`, private to the server) is not in it.
